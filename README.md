# Node-basics
The project is about basics of NodeJS from Odin Project
In this project, I have created a very basic informational site that contains 3 pages: index, about and contact-me using NodeJS to get hands on practice about back-end.
Project uses various built in modules such as http for creating server, url for parsing the url and fs module for fetching the local files.
